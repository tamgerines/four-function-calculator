## Four Function Calculator
pays homage to the ubiquitous blue calculators of elementary school

## How It Works
- use mouse or keyboard to input numbers and operators to perform simple arithmetic
- keyboard shortcuts:
  - return button: =
  - lowercase c: clear
- functions as a basic "four function"-style calculator; does not follow order of operations

## Known Issues
- keyboard input from numeric keypad not supported
- pressing 0 before entering other numbers causes a leading 0 to show up on the display. doesn't affect calculator functionality. example: 023 + 5 = 28
